## TheIdeaBox

This app is meant as an online repository where users can post submissions regarding project idea suggestions.

The inspiration of this web app was that many of us want to be creative and build our own apps, but most of us
have no idea of where to even begin. TheIdeaBox aims to solve that problem. It is a place where users can 
post their own suggestions, so that others who may be lacking of project ideas can come by and get inspiration.

Along with the name and description of the project, there is also a difficulty rating (beginner, intermediate, or expert)
which helps users determine whether that type of project is right for them. As well, there is a section for each submission
which allows the author of the original submission to specify some programming languages or framaeworks that would be 
appropriate for the given project.

The web app includes a 'like' system, which allows users to like any posts which they believe to be interesting. Posts
are displayed in descending order of the number of likes. This app is a WIP, so please DO NOT OVERUSE THE LIKE BUTTON.

# Implementation

This app was build using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The frontend was made using the React.js
framework. The backend/API layer was developed using Node.js and the Express.js library. To store submission data, the
database program MongoDB is used (hosted on Atlas.)
